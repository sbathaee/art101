			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
				The purpose of this lab was to get a basic understanding of how file
				structures work both in HTML/CSS and generally. To do this, we were told to
				create a main webpage that contains links to other Art 101 labs. Mine
				can be found <a href="../index.html">HERE</a>. Other required
				tasks included displaying a self-portrait, creating a bulleted list, and
				writing a lab report in HTML (which is what you are reading right now).
			</p>
			<h2>Difficulties</h2>
			<p>
				During this lab, I really got into the flow of doing CSS development,
				so I decided to take it up a notch. One of the biggest challenges I
				encountered was trying to put a text box next to my portrait. No matter
				how hard I tried, the portrait kept ending up underneath my text box.
				After some debugging, I found out that the issue was simply that they
				were in the same div. After giving the image its own div, I was able to
				pull off the feature nicely.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another problem I encountered was deciding where I wanted to put the
				background image file. I knew it would be best practice to put it inside
				of the main <code>img</code> folder, but I didn't know how to get the CSS file to
				find that image. Then, I had a realization that the <code>../</code> in front of a
				file name meant to go back a directory. I put the <code>../</code> into my CSS file
				where I referenced the background image, and it was able to find the file just
				fine.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				This was the first web development project that I have been really proud
				of. I worked super hard to learn a bunch of new HTML and CSS tricks, and
				I feel like it shows on my webpage. I also feel like I have a much better
				understanding of how to write HTML and CSS code. Before this project, I
				would google things too often and sort of cram in whatever I found
				on the internet. Now, I actually understand what each line of code is doing,
				and I feel like I'd be able to make adjustments to any aspect of the webpage
				with ease.
			</p>
			<p>
				Overall, I enjoyed this lab quite a bit, and I'm happy that I was able to
				practice the skills that I have been learning in class.
