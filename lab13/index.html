				<h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
				<h3>By Kenny Losier and Shayan Bathaee</h3>
			</div>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				The challenge for this lab was for each of us to experiment with loops. We
				were assigned a task that would familiarize ourselves with for and if loops
				within functions that would track multiples of numerical values, and assign
				a string to each one of them, per the user's desire.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				During this assignment, we didn't run into too many problems writing our FizzBuzzBoom
				function. The code posted in the assignment gave us a good starting point to get the
				function up and running. However, once we started to push past what was given, we
				were immediately met with some challenges. Our biggest problem was with getting the
				factorObj formatted properly. Every time we tried to add the number key, we ended up
				with a string key instead that said "num0". To work around this, we found out that
				inserting elements to the dictionary using the Object[key] = value method worked
				for our purposes. Another issue we encountered was with the fizz buzz function itself.
				In the function, we forgot to reset the output string at the end of our for loop, causing
				the output to have some weird irregularities. Thankfully, through a lot of console logs and
				tests, we figured out what the issue was and fixed it.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				The website you are currently on contains our results. Go ahead and input
				all desired values and examine your results!
