				<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
				<h3>By Kenny Losier and Shayan Bathaee</h3>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>
					The challenge for this lab is to experiment with jQuery and AJAX. We were
					instructed to find and choose an API to test. Instead of putting our focus
					on one endpoint for this API, we chose to randomly generate one each button
					click. We learned how to use AJAX to fetch the output from our API and display
					it on our HTML page.
				</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>
					For this lab, we had a difficult time interpreting the lab instructions, as
					they were very vague and not very clear with what it was actually demanding
					us to complete. We had to do much research on our own to fill in the gaps
					of the given instructions, which proved to be very difficult for us, since we
					do not have experience with APIs, endpoints, or AJAX. Once we figured out
					the path we needed to take, attempting to fetch the output using AJAX gave us
					some trouble as well. We had to add a chrome extension and debug our code
					many times in order for the image to properly display.
				</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>
					The results are contained within the button and link below. Have fun
					randomly generating comic strips with each button click!
