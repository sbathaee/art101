				<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>
					The goal of this lab was for us to gain experience using functions in
					JavaScript. As usual, we started out by creating an HTML file styled with
					CSS. After doing so, we were tasked with creating a function that takes in
					user input and sorts it alphabetically. We also took on two bonus challenges
					by creating multiple anagram functions, and making the <code>window.prompt()</code>
					happen outside of our function.
				</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>
					For this particular lab, we both encountered many problems. This was one
					of our first labs together that caused some frustration and presented
					difficult obstacles to overcome. First and foremost, we were not entirely
					sure what spacing and dimensions the anagram had to follow for the bonus
					task. Moreover, we were confused whether or not the different words entered
					by the user had to include the same amount of lettering as well. After that,
					we discovered that trying to space out a proper anagram proved to be a
					struggle. Plenty of debugging had to be done in order to complete our
					function that portioned the anagram of the user's name with correct spacing.
					There were times when we could not figure out why the anagram would not
					display and why it would not display the last word after it was randomized.
					These issues proved to be our toughest and lengthiest to overcome, but in
					the end, we persevered and kept debugging and googling until we could
					figure it out together.

				<h2>Results</h2>

					As for the results of this lab, you are currently on our html file that
					Shayan and Kenny created. Here is the JavaScript program that we ran
					and successfully executed:
