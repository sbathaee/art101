				<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
				<h3>By Kenny Losier and Shayan Bathaee</h3>
			</div>

				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>
					The challenge for this lab is for both partners to experiment with
					processing JSON from an API. We decided to cycle randomized comic strip
					endpoints from this API with the push of a button, as well as adding
					"previous" and "next" buttons as a way to cycle through without it
					being random. The datatype we used for our AJAX methods are JSON for
					this lab.
				</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>
					One problem we encountered was with trying to make the previous/next buttons
					loop back to the first and last comic. For example, if the user was at comic
					number 1 and hit previous, we wanted to show them the last comic (comic number
					2624). Our initial idea was to use the modulo operator to circularly index the
					comics. After messing around with that for a while, we struggled to get it to work
					and ended up abandoning the idea altogether because of the difficulty we had.
					However, while we were working on the CSS file, we came up with the idea of
					adding a simple if statement to the next and previous functions that checks
					if we are at either end, and if so, brings the user to the last/first comic.
				</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>
					This website displays all of our results. Go ahead and entertain yourself
					with the many comic strips available!
