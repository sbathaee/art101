				<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
				<h3>By Kenny Losier and Shayan Bathaee</h3>
			</div>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				For this lab, our goal was to get comfortable using conditional statements in
				JavaScript. To do so, we were tasked with creating a program that sorts
				a person into a Hogwarts house when they input their name. This program relies
				heavily on if, else, and else if statements, as well as comparison operators.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				In a general scope of the difficulty of this lab, we both did not encounter
				any problems at all with the regular tasks. The difficulties we encountered
				lied in Task X. We had a slight issue incorporating the house name in the same
				line, but soon found a span id that proved to be the exact solution to that
				problem. Another one of our problems with Task X was that of incorporating
				a description and name of each house in our results, which would replace the
				previous results, if there were any. There was plenty of repetition involved,
				but it was worth the extra work to implement the extra code.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				Here are our results! Go ahead and see which house your fate rests in...
			</p>
			<div class="input-output">
				<h3>Welcome to Hogwarts!</h3>
				<p>Dare to see which house you belong to?</p>
				Please enter your full name for sorting:
