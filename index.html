			<h1>Hello!</h1>
			<h2>My name is Shayan. Here is a little bit about me:</h2>
			<div id="professional_bio">
				<p>
					I am a 3rd-year Computer Engineering major and Computer Science minor
					at University of California, Santa Cruz. I was born and raised in San
					Diego, and I want to be a Software Engineer in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have been programming for about 2 years, primarily in C/C++. One of my
					favorite projects I ever worked on was the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
					problem. The objective was to try to find connections between any two
					actors and movies they have starred in. I implemented a solution using
					a graph made up of actors as nodes, and movies as edges. After
					performing a breadth-first search, I could find the shortest path
					between any two actors!

						When I'm not doing schoolwork, I like to do things that are active and
						outdoors. My interests tend to change often, but right now I am into
						the following activities:
						<ul>
							<li>Mountain biking</li>
							<li>Driving</li>
							<li>Listening to music</li>
							<li>Hiking</li>
							<li>Programming</li>
