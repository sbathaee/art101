				<h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
				<h3>By Kenny Losier and Shayan Bathaee</h3>
			</div>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				The challenge for this particular lab is to experiment with DOM manipulation.
				We were asked to create new elements in JavaScript associated with our
				output div in our HTML file, then display our understanding of changing their
				attributes and appending them to one another.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				This lab for us was particularly straightforward and simple. However,
				we did have an issue figuring out a way to initialize two buttons in our
				JavaScript that would display in our HTML and the local website separately.
				After we were able to figure that out by debugging and using Professor
				Modes' slideshow, we had an issue figuring out how to separate the buttons
				with whitespace and figuring out how to append one button before the other.
				Taking on Task X was a slight issue for us, but we were able to figure it
				out fairly quickly on our own! We had some more fun and decided to change
				the color of the buttons and the colors of the text that appear once each
				button is clicked!
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				Our results are displayed on this HTML website! Enjoy button mashing!
