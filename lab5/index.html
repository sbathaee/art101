			<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				The challenge for this lab was to create our first JavaScript program to
				be linked in our HTML file. For our program, we were asked to create some
				variables to describe the cars that we own and print out their values. We
				decided to go a step further by creating a <code>Car</code> class, and
				initializing two car objects called <code>shayanCar</code> and
				<code>kennyCar</code>. Our car class had the attributes make, model, color,
				and year. It also contained a method called age(), which can be used to
				calculate the age of a car.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				Overall, there was only one problem that we encountered together while
				working on this lab. The problem was a very minor spelling error, which
				threw off our whole code. For about 5 to 10 minutes, we had trouble
				spotting this error, as it was very obscure and easy to miss. Our code
				would run about 2 lines before returning nothing. It happened to be our
				third print statement for Shayan's car color, which read
				"document.wirteln()", rather than "document.writeln()", which was
				frustrating, but laughable.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				At the end of this lab, both of us had a better understanding of how to
				declare and manipulate JavaScript variables. We also got to learn how to
				create classes and methods, construct strings, and write output. It was
				exciting to finally see CSS, HTML, and JavaScript working together on our
				website.
