			<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				The challenge for this lab was to work with a partner and collectively
				experiment with JavaScript arrays and objects. We had to declare arrays
				and objects and express our comfort calling them and assigning variables
				within them. Both of us had to reference our variables we created in
				the console. The goal of this lab was to continue building on our comfort
				using the console, JavaScript, linking JavaScript to our html website,
				and practicing more with arrays and objects.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				As a whole, we did not encounter many problems during this lab. The first
				minimal problem we both encountered was with the original code in the
				console that was given to us to define the "age" variable, which did not
				calculate the age until we tampered with the code on our own, and were able
				to fix it. Once more, we did have one typo in our "For" loop in our JavaScript,
				which caused the loop to not function properly. We discovered this mistake
				soon after, and was able to continue on working and making progress without
				many other errors.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				Well, the page that you are currently on contain our results. On this
				page you will find our JavaScript output and our transportation images for
				both Shayan and Kenny, with captions to accomodate both.
