		<h2>Challenges:</h2>
		<p>
			Our challenge for this lab was to get some experience with pseudocoding. To
			do this, we started out by coming up with a basic task (baking banana bread),
			and writing out the steps as pseudocode. From there, we came up with a computer
			task to complete and wrote pseudocode for that as well. The computer task we
			chose was parsing thorugh a file and replacing every instance of a delimiter
			character with a new line.

		<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<p>Overall, we encountered very minimal problems with Task 4. The issues that
			we did encounter were also easily accessible and fixable. For instance, the
			only problem we had to resolve included the indentation of our "Everyday Task"
			list. In order to solve this, we removed the indent and then hit enter to
			reset the indentation to our desired output.

			<p>Pseudocode an Everyday task: Making Banana Bread</p>
			<pre><code>
				1.  Gather ingredients
				2.  Gather tools
				3.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit
				4.  Add half cup of butter to mixing bowl
				5.  Mix butter with cup of sugar and three overripe bananas
				6.  Add in two eggs and three tablespoons of milk
					a.  Stir until thoroughly incorporated
				7.  Add two cups of flour and one teaspoon of baking soda
					a.  Stir gently
				8.  Grease two loaf pans
				9.  Scoop half the mixture into each loaf pan
					a.  Make sure mixture rests even in the pan
				10. Bake for 50-55 minutes or until golden brown
				11. Let cool to preferred temperature
