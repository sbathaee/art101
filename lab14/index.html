				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>
					The challenge for this lab is to practice debugging with a partner on
					each other's past labs that need to be reworked and debugged if there
					were any coding errors or unintentional outputs for each lab. Applying
					new skills and newly obtained knowledge is a critical focus and a very
					important process highlighted in this lab.
				</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>
					Since we reviewed our work and deemed it unnecessary to debug our previous
					labs, we encountered no problems with this lab. We decided to still have some
					fun and create a neat website!
				</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>
					Well, we don't meant to disappoint, but we do not have any debugging that
					was needed for our previous labs.

				<h2>Debugging</h3>

					We apologize. Enjoy some adorable pictures of Kirby instead:
