				<h1>Lab 8: Anonymous Functions and Callbacks</h1>
				<h3>By Kenny Losier and Shayan Bathaee</h3>
			</div>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				The challenge of this particular lab is to experiment with anonymous functions
				and callbacks. We were asked to display our knowledge and comfortability
				creating and calling functions and arrays within the console, and using that
				for our JavaScript file. The extra challenge was to research how to reference
				our JavaScript file in the html file while scripting it in the header section.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				Overall, this lab proposed some interesting and frustrating challenges
				for both of us to encounter. For starters, the console proved to be tedious,
				as we wanted to exceed the proposed assignment and create a more challenging
				and complex functions and operations. We first had the idea to create a window
				prompt that would ask the user to input what operation they would like to
				implement. However, we could not figure out how to code the window prompt
				to choose the entire array, and perform the operation on all elements
				in the array, so that ended up being a huge messy failure. We had to
				copy and paste the working code for our exponent operation and our digit
				counter into a new console so it come out as a clean, collected console
				of code. Finally, we had our main issue with Task X, which was trying to
				implement our JavaScript code into out html without having to navigate to
				the console tab to access it.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				Well, here are our results from our JavaScript, which was originated
				in the console! We coded and implemented it as a button in this html file
				so that way you do not need to travel to the console to view it.
