				<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events & Forms</h1>
				<h3>By Kenny Losier and Shayan Bathaee</h3>
			</div>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				The challenge for this lab is to experiment with JavaScript events with
				a partner. The goal is to attach an event listener to our buttons that
				retrieves the values of our input fields, runs the values through
				our functions, saves the results, and replaces this html in <xmp><div id="output"></xmp>
				with the results.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				Overall, we both were able to conquer this lab with miniscule problems that appeared.
				The first problem we encountered was how to implement the html id code as plain text
				under our "Challenge" section. Until the end of our coding, we both forgot to import
				our swap function and implement each button with a corresponding event listener.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				Our results are displayed on this HTML website! Click each button to display
				the each differing result! Try different inputs and have fun!
			</p>
			<h3>Script Output</h3>
			<div id="output">
				<button id="spacedAnagramBtn">Generate a Properly Spaced Anagram of Your Name</button><br>
				<button id="randomAnagramBtn">Generate a Randomly Spaced Anagram of Your Name</button><br>
				<button id="sortBtn">Click Me to Sort Your Name Alphabetically!</button>
